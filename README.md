# MTIT-Assignment-1

â€¢	Introduction

This assignment is about implementing the Producer-Consumer scenario using the OSGi framework. For this assignment, we developed an OSGi architecture for the Online Coffee Store.
Here Producer-Consumer scenario has been implemented using the OSGi framework. Online Coffee Store features are developed related to the OSGi architecture using Java and the Apache Felix framework. There are separate service bundles as procedures while having consumers for consumption.
Online Coffee Store is fabricated around the services of ordering coffees, ordering tools/equipment related to coffee making, delivery, and feedback, which covers all the main components highlighting a demandable coffee store. As the services sound by their names, the coffee ordering service is to order the coffees by choosing the coffee type and specializing by strength relevant to each customer. Equipment order service is to order the tools, that relate to the coffee-making industry, which can be taken from specified quantities for each type on customer preferences. Delivery service is to know delivery charges for orders based on the distance from the destination location. And finally, the Feedback service to rate overall satisfaction with customer details.
All the services are created by focusing on fulfilling customer requirements in one place, which completes the services related to the Online Coffee Store.
